## Overview
In an effort to woo investors, we have been using Tableau to create visualizations of citibike data from New York City.  Because if citibike is successful in NYC, it'll definitly be successful in Des Moines, Iowa!

## Results

### Checkout Time for Users

Looking at the graph above, we see that most rides only last five minutes.

### Checkout Time by Gender

When we break the users out by gender, we see that females and users with an unknown gender are more likely to have longer rides.

### Trips By Weekday

Because the most popular times are 7/8 am and 5/6 pm on weekdays, we can assume the majority of trips are users biking to and from work.

### Trips by Gender

We still see the same workday commute pattern when we split the data out by gender.  People who didn't record their gender are more frequent users on the weekend.  Possibly because tourists (who are most likely to visit on a weekend) are also less likely to fill out their profiles with all of the information as they won't need a citi bike for long.

### User Trips by Gender

When we look at customer vs subscriber, it further validates my hypothesis that tourists are less likely to fill out a profile.  Most customers have an unknown gender because they will only use a citi bike for the short time they are in the city.  Subscribers take the time to fill out a complete profile.

### Top Starting Locations

Most of the starting locations are held in between Central Park and Lower Manhatten

### Top Ending Locations

The starting and ending locations look almost identical.  There is no need to worry about constant reallocation of bikes as the customers seem to naturally take care of it.

## Summary
Overall, it seems as though citibikes are thriving in NYC.  In case our investors are still a little weary, I think a graph of age and frequency of use could be beneficial.  This would allow investors to assess how much the bikes will be used given the demographics of Des Moines.  I also would like to see a user type by age heat map.  Then we could forecast the amount of revenue we'd lock with subscribers given the age brackets of Des Moines
